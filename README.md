# Truebit Verification for Scrypt.

## Overview

This repo provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the Truebit smart contract system.<br/>

It enables a step-by-step running and verification of the [Scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) hashing function on the EVM.<br/>

This can form the basis of a Dogecoin/Ethereum relay. Dogecoin uses Scrypt for its Proof-of-Work algorithm, specifically to calculate the block hash. Therefore, an ability to compute Scrypt hashes is required in order to verify the validity of Dogecoin transactions, as it allows one to check Merkle proofs from a known block header. This computation is too large given Ethereum's gas constraints, making it an ideal use case for Truebit.<br/>

For more context on how relays work, look at the [BTCRelay](https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay) project.<br/>

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, first install npm dependencies:
```
# install npm dependencies:
npm install

# install ganache-cli
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Then, you can run tests by executing the `run.sh` script:
```
./run.sh
```

Or run the truffle tests manually:
```
# first start ganache-cli
ganache-cli

# run tests
truffle test
```
